/**
 * Per-compaction archive derivation.
 *
 * Pi's SessionManager persists every entry to JSONL — including
 * `CompactionEntry` records that mark where the SDK summarised and
 * dropped older messages from the in-memory context. The chat UI
 * reads `session.messages` (the post-compaction view); without
 * something like this module the user's pre-compaction history
 * appears to vanish.
 *
 * This module reads the full entries array, walks each compaction,
 * and produces a `CompactionEvent[]` shape the client renders as
 * inline "Compacted N messages → Y tokens" cards with the archived
 * messages one click away.
 *
 * Shape contract:
 * - `id`            — the CompactionEntry's id (stable across reloads)
 * - `timestamp`     — when the compaction happened (ISO 8601)
 * - `summary`       — the SDK-generated prose summary
 * - `tokensBefore`  — context size at the moment of compaction
 * - `insertBeforeIndex` — index in the post-compaction `session.messages`
 *                          array where the card should render. The card
 *                          appears IMMEDIATELY ABOVE the message at
 *                          this index — i.e. between messages[i-1] and
 *                          messages[i]. When 0, the card renders at the
 *                          very top of the chat (the entire pre-
 *                          compaction history was archived).
 * - `archivedMessages` — the AgentMessage[] that the SDK removed from
 *                        the context. Rendered through the existing
 *                        Message component when the user expands the
 *                        card. Slice is from "the compaction immediately
 *                        before this one (or session start)" up to but
 *                        not including the new compaction.
 *
 * Ported from pi-forge's packages/server/src/compaction-history.ts.
