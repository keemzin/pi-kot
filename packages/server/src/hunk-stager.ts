/**
 * Hunk-level staging. Builds a synthetic unified diff containing only
 * the user-selected hunks of a file, then feeds it to
 * `git apply --cached [--reverse] --recount` via stdin.
 *
 * Why this works:
 *   - `git apply --cached` updates the index without touching the
 *     working tree — exactly what `git add` does for a whole file.
 *   - `--recount` rewrites the per-hunk line-count fields, so we
 *     don't have to recompute them after subsetting hunks (the line
 *     numbers in `@@ -X,Y +A,B @@` may be stale relative to a partial
 *     patch; git fixes them itself).
 *   - `--reverse` flips the patch so unstaging from the staged-side
 *     diff applies cleanly. Symmetric with stage.
 *
 * Binary files have no `@@` hunks (`git diff` emits
 * `Binary files a/foo and b/foo differ`); we reject upfront so the
 * UI can surface a clear "binary files can't be hunk-staged" error
 * rather than confusing the user with a `git apply` failure mode.
